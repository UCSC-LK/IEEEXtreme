=======================

* String manipulations
* Conversion to and from strings
* Graph algorithms
    - Kruskal MST
    - Bellmanford Shortest Path
    - Dijkstra's Shortest Path
* General Algorithms
    - Longest Common Sequence(and tracer)

All by just using standard C++, should be able to build with MSVC++(2010+) and
GCC.
